# Operators

# Arithmetic  Operators (+,-,*,%,/ **)

a = 30

b = 20

print(a + b) # adding
print(a - b) # subtract
print(a * b) # multiplying
print(a % b) # division which gives remainder as an output
print(a / b) # division which gives quotient as an output
print(a ** b) # to find power

# Asignment operators (Assigning a value to variable name)

a = 40

a *=20  # using all operators(a+=20,a-=20,a%=20,a/=20)

print(a)

# Comparison Operators (Comparing the values or data)

a = 20

b = 40

print(a == b) # checks two values are equal or not
print(a != b) # checks two values are  not equal or not
print(a > b) # checks a is greater than b
print(a < b) # checks a is less than b
print(a >= b) # checks a is greater than or equals to b
print(a <= b) # checks a is less than b or equals to b

# Logical Operators


a = 20

b = 40

# Logical 'OR'

if(a > b or a < b): # 'or' means either one value should be true then it is true otherwise false

    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')

# Logical 'AND'

if(a > b or a < b): # 'and' means both  values should be true then it is true otherwise false

    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
