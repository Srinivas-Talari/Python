# Interpreter & Compilation

'''Both do the same work(source code to machine code) but in a different way i.e the compiler compiles all the source and finds errors in compilation time only but where as interpreter checks code line by line and that too in run-time(during exceution of code)

Compilation langs(c,c++,etc..)

Interpreted langs(JS,Python,etc..)
